A small linting and building command line tool for reproducible R analysis with Docker at QBiC.

## Steps to reproducible R analyses

1. Create project from [template](doc/Rmageddon-cookiecutter.md) 
2. [Resolve](doc/Rmageddon.md) conda packages from R `sessionInfo` 
3. [Lint](doc/Rmageddon.md) the project against the guidelines


## Motivation

Performing a reproducible analysis with R and share the environment status of an R installation with the 
necessary packages and all that with the correct version is a very challenging task.

In order to face this issue, under the umbrella of better reproducibility of computational results, we created
**Rmageddon**, a small command-line tool, that assists in the build of Docker container with specified version of R and
a dedicated, version-defined package installation. Moreover, Rmageddon provides cookiecutter templates for the easy creation of docker environments for your R analysis.

The container collection is hosted on a different GitHub repository: [R-container-lib](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/r-container-lib). All containers there passed the linting and have been build with Rmageddon.

## Usage

The complete workflow for the creation of a new container for your R-analysis is depicted in the following image:

This README will guide you through the complete process of starting with the sessioninfo of your R-analysis and finally sharing your docker powered R-environment on our [R-container-lib](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/r-container-lib).

1. Create a sessioninfo from your R-analysis. The official R-documentation explains this process well: [Sessioninfo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.5.2/topics/sessionInfo).
2. Install Rmageddon. This is explained in the documentation for Rmageddon: [Rmageddon documentation](doc/Rmageddon.md)
3. Create a docker environment using the cookiecutter template. This process is described in the documentation for the [Rmageddon-cookiecutter](doc/Rmageddon-cookiecutter.md)
4. Run Rmageddon **build** on your sessioninfo. This is again explained in the documentation for Rmageddon: [Rmageddon documentation](doc/Rmageddon.md), especially in the **subcommand build** section.
5. Ensure that your environment.yml file is now or still in your R-container which you created in step 3
6. Add your R-scripts that you used for your analysis to your just created R-container 
7. Validate your just created R-container: Run Rmageddon **lint** on it. Please refer to the documentation for Rmageddon: [Rmageddon documentation](doc/Rmageddon.md), especially in the **subcommand lint** section.
8. If validation was successful your R-container is now ready to be added to our R-container library. Please refer to the final documentation of the [R-container-lib](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/r-container-lib).
9. Enjoy!
